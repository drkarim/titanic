# Titanic Survival Prediction:

*Acknowledgements and credits: This amazing kernel by [Betul](https://www.kaggle.com/berenkeskin)*

Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Variables and Their Types:

* Survival: Survival -> 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Pclass: Ticket class -> 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
* Sex: Sex
* Age: Age in years
* SibSp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
* Parch: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket: Ticket number
* Fare: Passenger fare
* Cabin: Cabin number
* Embarked: Port of Embarkation -> C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

## Variable Notes:

- Pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
* 1st = Upper
* 2nd = Middle
* 3rd = Lower
* Age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

- SibSp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
- Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)
- Parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- Parent = mother, father
- Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
